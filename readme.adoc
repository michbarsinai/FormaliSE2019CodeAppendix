= Verification of Liveness and Safety Properties of Behavioral Programs Using BPjs

== Code Appendix

This repository contains the code referred to in the paper. Directory content:

link:sample-code[]::
  Contains code shown in the paper, and sample outputs.

link:performance-meters[]::
  Contains code for measuring the performance of BPjs, and for comparing this performance to related works.


[NOTE]
All code in this examples assume that you have bpjs in the `$PATH` environment variable. As an alternative, one can replace the `bpjs` command with `java -jar BPjs-0.9.7.uber.jar` (or any other version later than 0.9.7).

[WARNING]
You must use the uber jar, that contains dependencies used by BPjs (such as Mozilla Rhino).
